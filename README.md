SVG animation with CSS and Vanilla JS. Inspired and based on a YouTube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh3kt0Xqea0) by Daily Tution, it presents expanded functionalities, including an overlay modal, background music, custom van illustration and animations. So far it only serves as a sandbox for future experimentations.
